I managed to implement a generic list module using void* pointers that pointed to after
a node in the list. I used two half nodes disguised as sentinel nodes on either sides
of the list to avoid the pointer leaving the confines of the list in memory. I also
implemented automated testing of each of the functions, a combination of the functions
and other tasks such as traversing the list or returning values from the list.
